# downwell_danmaku

a really f**king simple danmaku game with [Downwell](http://store.steampowered.com/app/360740) art style

largely based on [adonaac](https://github.com/adonaac)'s blog article

uses these library (I only kept the necessary files)
- https://github.com/rxi/classic
- https://github.com/vrld/hump

(also the nyan cat music is used...)
